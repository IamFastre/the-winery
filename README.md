# The Winery: Where We Whine (No it`s not about Wine)

Welcome, dear visitor, to The Winery! No, sadly, we don't make wine here. But we *do* provide a space where you can whine... or, you know, share your creative brilliance. Close enough for us, and hopefully for you too! This is a social platform, a digital vineyard, if you will, where the grapes are ideas, and the fermentation is your imagination.

Here, you get to craft and share what we affectionately call "cards" (because "posts" is *so* last season). These cards can be filled with whatever your heart desires: prose, poetry, pictures of your cat, existential dread â€“ the sky's the limit, darling. And because sharing is caring (and because it's a social platform), you get to share your cards with other like-minded whiners.

## Getting Started: Fermenting Your First Piece

Eager to start fermenting your own pieces? Wonderful! Here's how to dive into the vat of creativity:

1.  **Log In or Create an Account:** If you're already one of our esteemed whiners, log in! If not, don't worry, you can create a new account. It's quick, easy, and painless (mostly).
2.  **Compose Some Oeuvres d'Art:** Once you're in, the world is your oyster... or rather, your winery. Go ahead and start creating those cards!

## Technologies Used: The Secret Sauce

We've concocted this fine vintage using:

*   **Next.js:** For a smooth, server-side rendered experience. It's like a fine wine, but for web apps.
*   **Supabase:** Our backend. It keeps all your data safe.

*   **React:** For building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:** For type safety and developer experience.
* **Sass:** For CSS preprocessing and organization.

## Code Structure: The Lay of the Land

Here's a little tour of the vineyard:

*   **`pages`:** This is where Next.js works its magic. Each file here corresponds to a different page on the site.
*   **`components`:** All our React components live here.
*   **`styles`:** CSS files for styling the components and pages.
* **`lib`**: helper functions

## Supabase Configuration: The Backbone

Supabase is crucial for this project. Here's how to get it working:

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:** If you don't have one, create an account and a new project.
2.  **Database Setup:** You may need to create tables in your Supabase database.
3.  **API Keys:** Grab your project URL and anon key from the Supabase project settings and add them to your `.env` file as mentioned in the installation steps.
